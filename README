# Coronary Artery Disease Risk Prediction in Childhood Cancer Survivors

This repository contains code to develop and validate a long-term coronary artery disease (CAD) risk prediction model in childhood cancer survivors, using clinical, treatment, and genetic data.

## Background

Childhood cancer survivors face a 10-fold increased risk for CAD compared to the general population. Existing risk models often rely on self-reported outcomes and exclude genetic predisposition. This project addresses these limitations by integrating physician-adjudicated CAD outcomes and a multi-ancestry polygenic risk score (PRS).

## Methods

We used data from two cohorts:

- **St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE)** – Discovery cohort (*n* = 4,145)
- **Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS)** – Validation cohort (*n* = 7,065)

Predictors included:
- **Demographics**: age, sex, ancestry
- **Cancer treatment exposures**: cumulative anthracycline and chest radiation dose
- **Cardiometabolic risk factors**: BMI, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking
- **Genetics**: multi-ancestry CAD PRS (PGS003725 from the [PGS Catalog](https://www.pgscatalog.org/score/PGS003725/))

We used Cox proportional hazards regression to model the 25-year risk of CAD (CTCAE grade ≥3), selected predictors using elastic net regularization with 10-fold cross-validation, assessed model performance with time-dependent AUC, and estimated cumulative incidence of CAD by risk strata.
